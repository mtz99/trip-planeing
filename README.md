# Trip Planeing

Just a simple suite of web applets designed around planning your next vacation/trip! A work in progress.

# Includes:
1. Notebook
2. More to come!


#Notebook overview:

This is just a basic notepad for users to quickly jot down any activity, food or hotel ideas for their 
next trip, as well as transportation options! There is some markdown support for those who want to
keep a good visual organization of their notes. Users can also search through their notes by keyword
and/or category. The following are some screenshots of this applet in action:

A java springboot stack handles the backend logic, and currently all user data is stored in a PostgreSQL table:

#Next steps for this webapp:
As of now, I would like to get the following features added to this webapp overall, ordered by priority:

1. Security and user login via Google.
2. A second applet, which will take the user's stored notes and generate a possible trip itinerary via AI integration.
3. Server hosting for this webapp, looking into using either a personal homeserver or AWS cloud services.

Of course, there are many more ideas, but given this is a passion project I'm doing on the side in addition to a full time job, we'll see what happens!
